Hello fellow reader!

To play the game, you need to download Unity at this stage of the game. 

Open the folder “DINOFLIGHT” and you’ll get access to the whole game and all the “materials” used. The game is not complete as of now, but I will continue finishing up the game and hopefully publish it in the future. 

You can find the code by clicking: Assets > Scripts and opening the .cs files via your preferred code editor. 

Thank you and have a nice day!
